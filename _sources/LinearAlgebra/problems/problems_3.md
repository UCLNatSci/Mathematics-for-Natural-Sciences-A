Given a nonzero vector $v_0 \in \mathbb{R}^3$ we define a function $T:\mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ by

$$T(x) = v_0 \times x$$

## Question 9

<!-- yutsumura 550 -->

## Question 10

Define $K_n$ to be the matrix with $2$s on the main diagonal and $-1$s on the subdiagonal and superdiagonal. $K_4$ is shown below:

$$K_4 = \begin{pmatrix}2&-1&0&0\\-1&2&-1&0\\0&-1&2&-1\\ 0&0&-1&2\end{pmatrix}.$$

Show that $\det(K_n) = n + 1$ using the following two different methods:

1. Using row operations to reduce the matrix to a triangular matrix [the first row operation is $r_2\rightarrow r_2+\frac{1}{2}r_1$ which leaves $r_2 = (0, \frac{3}{2}, -1, 0, \ldots$). Continue the row operations and spot the pattern].
2. Using the cofactor formula [start by writing $\det(K_n)$ in terms of $\det(K_{n-1})$ and $\det(K_{n-2})$]

## Question 11

Find $(2 \times 2)$ matrices with

1. Two distinct eigenvalues and two independent eigenvectors.
2. Two distinct eigenvalues but only one independent eigenvector.
3. A single eigenvalue and two independent eigenvectors.
4. A single eigenvalue with one independent eigenvector.

[Two vectors are dependent if they are multiples of each other.]

[One of these is impossible! Which, and why?]
