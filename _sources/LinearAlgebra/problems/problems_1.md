# Linear Algebra Problems 1

## Question 1

<!-- Yutsumura 267 -->

Solve the following system of linear equations by transforming its augmented matrix to reduced echelon form. Which are the free variables and pivot variables? Write your answer in the form $v_0 + t_1v_1 + \cdots + t_kv_k$ where $t_i \in \mathbb{R}$ and $v_i$ are vectors of length $5$. Describe the solution geometrically.

$$
\begin{align}
x_1 - x_3 - 3x_5 &= 1\\
3x_1 + x_2 - x_3 + x_4 - 9x_5 &= 3\\
x_1 - x_3 + x_4 - 2x_5 &= 1.
\end{align}

1\. Reduce $A$ and $B$ to row echelon form. Which columns correspond to free variables?

a) $A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 6\\
1 & 2 & 3 & 6 & 9\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}$
b) $B = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 4 & 2\\
0 & 4 & 4\\
0 & 8 & 8\\
\end{pmatrix}$

2\. For the matrices $A$ and $B$, find a special solution for each free variable.

3\. Calculate the null space of each matrix.

4\. *True or false, with explanation*: The null space of a matrix is the same as the null space of its reduced echelon form.

Kirchoff's Law states that at a junction of an electrical circuit $\mathrm{current~in}=\mathrm{current~out}$. At junction $1$ this says that $y_3 = y_1+y_4$.

 1. Write the four equations for Kirchoff's Law at each of the four nodes.
 2. Reduce the resulting matrix to reduced row echelon form.
 3. Write down the three special solutions.

## Question 4

<!-- Yutsumura 87 -->

Find a cubic polynomial

$$p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3$$

such that $p(1) = 1, p'(1)=5, p(-1)=3$ and $p'(-1)=1$.

## Question 5

<!-- Yutsumura 272 -->

Let

$$A = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 3\\ 2 & 4\end{pmatrix}.$$

1\. Find all matrices

$$B = \begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{pmatrix}$$

such that $AB=BA$.

2\. Use your answer to part 1 to find a $(2 \times 2)$ matrix $C$ such that $AC\neq CA$.


## Question 6

<!-- https://people.math.carleton.ca/~kcheung/math/notes/MATH1107/wk05/05_elementary_matrices_example.html -->

Let

$$M = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 2\\-2 & 0 & -3\\0 & 2 & 0\end{pmatrix}.$$

We can reduce $M$ to reduced row echelon form by performing a sequence of *elementary row operations*. The first elementary row operation is $r_2 + 2r_1 \rightarrow r_2$.

An *elementary matrix* is a matrix which has the same effect as an elementary row operation. For example, left-multiplying by

$$E_1 = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\2 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$$

has the same effect as the elementary row operation $r_2 + 2r_1 \rightarrow r_2$.

1\. Calculate $E_1M$ to show that left-multiplying by $E_1$ has the same effect as the elementary row operation on the matrix $M$.

2\. Determine the elementary matrix $E_2$ that has the same effect as the elementary row operation $r_2 \leftrightarrow r_3$ which swaps row 2 and row 3, then calculate $E_2\left(E_1M\right)$.

3\. Determine the remaining two elementary row operations that reduce the matrix $M$ to row reduced form and calculate the elementary matrices $E_3$ and $E_4$.

4\. Calculate the matrix $A = E_4E_3E_2E_1$ and check that

$$AM = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.$$

5\. Use your answer to part 4 to solve the equation $Mx=b$ where

$$b = \begin{pmatrix}4\\2\\-1\end{pmatrix}.$$
