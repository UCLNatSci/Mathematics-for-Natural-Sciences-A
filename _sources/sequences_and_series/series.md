# Sequences and Series


## Sequences

````{admonition} Definition
:class: note
A **sequence** is a set of terms where order matters, written as follows:

```{math}
:label: sequencedef
    u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n
```
Here, the size of the sequence (the number of terms) is $n$.
The $i$-th term in the sequence may be denoted by $u_i$ where $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$.

The labels $u$, and $i$ are arbitrary, and we could just as well use other letters to represent them.
Sequences can have finite $n<\infty$ (e.g. telephone numbers) or infinite sizes
$n \to \infty$ (e.g. the prime numbers).
````

The sequences that we will examine in this course are numerical patterns.  Much of mathematics is concerned with patterns in both mathematical constructs and nature, and the study of sequences
provides a firm grounding for this endeavour.

Mathematical patterns can generally be expressed as formula for the $i$th term. For instance, the formula below generates the sequence $-1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20$ by taking $i=1,\dots 8$ :

```{math}
u_i = 2 + 3 (i-2)
```

Notice that the size of the terms in this sequence grows without bound as the number of terms is increased.

### Recurrence relationships

It is sometimes possible to express a sequence as a formula that relates the $n$th term of the sequence as some combination of the previous terms. This is known as a
recurrence relation.

````{admonition} Definition
:class: note
A well-know example that arises in many natural systems is the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

```{math}
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \dots
```
````

This sequence is generated by starting with the sequence $1,1$ and finding the next number in the sequence by adding the two previous numbers together, 
e.g. $0+1=\mathbf{1}$, $1+1=\mathbf{2}$, $1+2=\mathbf{3}$, $2+3=\mathbf{5}$, $3+5=\mathbf{8}$, etc.

The sequence can be expressed with the recurrence relation
```{math}
:label: recreldef
u_i=u_{i-1}+u_{i-2}
```
The recurrence relation {eq}`recreldef` specifies the $i$-th term provided we have the term for $i-1$ and $i-2$.
It is because of this formula that it is necessary to provide the first two terms of the sequence, $u_1=0$ and $u_2=1$,
to find the rest of the sequence.


````{admonition} Python code for Fibonacci sequence
:class: tip
Note that the Fibonnaci recurrence relation will generate a different sequence to the Fibonacci sequence when the
starting terms are different (e.g. $u_1=10$ and $u_2=11$).
````

u1, u2 = 1, 1 # first two values
count = 0 # counter
while count < nterms: # while loop
       print(u1) # print values     
       nth = u1 + u2 # recurrence relation             
       u1 = u2 # update values       
       u2 = nth # update values       
       count += 1 # update counter
```


````{admonition} Practice Question
:class: seealso, dropdown
1. What sort of numbers does the recurrence relation $u_i = 2 + u_{i-1}$ produce when $u_1=2$ and when $u_1=1$? 
2. A sequence is defined by the recurrence relation $u_{n+1} = 3u_{n}$ with $u_1 = 1$, determine the formula for $u_n$.
````

````{admonition} Solution
:class: seealso, dropdown
We can write a Python script to generate the recurrence relation $u_i = 2 + u_{i-1}$:
```python
nterms = 10 # number of terms
u = 1 # first value
count = 0 # counter
while count < nterms: # while loop
       print(u) # print values     
       u = u + 2 # recurrence relation                   
       count += 1 # update counter
```
1. If we run the code, we will see that this recurrence relation produces odd numbers if $u_1 = 1$ and even numbers if $u_1 = 2$.

2. If we run the code, we will see that this recurrence relation produces $u_n = 3^n$.
````

Recurrence relations, although simple, can produce surprisingly complicated behaviours.
For further reading you may like to study the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map):
```{math}
:label: logisticmap
u_{i+1} = r u_{i} (1 - u_i) \ ,
```
where $r$ is a constant.
This equation (which models amongst other things animal population growth) opened up the field of chaos theory.

## Series

Series play a central role in calculus and are the main reason why we introduce sequences in the section above.

````{admonition} Definition
:class: note
A **series** is the sum of a sequence of terms, written as follows:

```{math}
:label: seriesdef
\sum_{i=m}^n u_i = u_1 + u_2 + \ldots + u_n \,
```
where $m \le n$, and usually $m=1$.
````

In short, a series is simply the sum of a sequence. 
We can replace the upper value $n$ with $\infty$ for an [infinite series.  To give an example, the series of the infinite sequence $(u_1,u_2,u_3,\dots)$ is written as $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^\infty u_i$.

We say that $\displaystyle\sum_{i=m}^n u_i$ for $n < \infty$ is a partial sum because the series is partially added up to just the $n$-th term.

````{admonition} Python Code
:class: tip
Here is some Python code for a sequence defined by the recurrence relation $u_k = u_{k-1}+\frac{1}{2}$ with $u_1=0$.  It calculates the first ten terms of the sequence and the resulting series.

n = 10 # number of terms
seq = 0 # first value of sequence
ser = 0 # first value of series
count = 0 # counter
while count < n: # while loop
       print(seq, ser) # print series value    
       seq = seq + 0.5 # update sequence
       ser = ser + seq # update series                   
       count += 1 # update counter
```




### Summations

Character $\Sigma$ is the Greek letter sigma, written in upper case, and denotes a summation.

We would read $\sum_{i=1}^n u_i$ as "the sum of $u_i$ from $i=1$ to $i=n$".

For example
```{math}
\sum_{i=1}^4 i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
```
is the sum of $i$ from $i=1$ to $i=4$

```{math}
\sum_{i=1}^4 2 i = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20.
```
is the sum of $2 i$ from $i=1$ to $i=4$

From this example it should be clear that, in general:
```{math}
:label: summationrule
\sum_{i=1}^n a u_i = a \sum_{i=1}^n u_i
```
where $a$ is a constant.

````{admonition} Warning!
:class: warning
Take note that
```{math}
\sum_{i=1}^n (a + u_i) \neq a + \sum_{i=1}^n u_i
```
For example, $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^4 (1+i) = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14$.

The correct way to read this is:
```{math}
\sum_{i=1}^n (a + u_i) \neq \sum_{i=1}^n a + \sum_{i=1}^n u_i = na  + \sum_{i=1}^n u_i

## Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions

We now introduce the arithmetic progression (or the arithmetic sequence) and the geometric progression (or geometric sequence).
These sequences have the nice property that their series can be found straightforwardly.

### Arithmetic progression

````{admonition} Definition
An arithmetic progression (otherwise known as an arithmetic sequence) is a sequence of $n$ terms which all have a "common
difference" $d$, written as follows:

```{math}
:label: apdef
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, \dots, a + (n-1) d
```
where $a$ is an arbitrary number.
````

An example of an arithmetic progression is the sequence $3,5,7,9,11,13$ in which the first term is $a=3$, the common difference is $d=2$ and the
number of terms is $n=6$.
An infinite arithmetic progression is given by the case where $n \to \infty$.

The $i$-th term of the arithmetic progression can be expressed as the following recurrence relation:
```{math}
: label : aprrdef
u_i=a+(i-1)d
```


````{admonition} Python code for arithmetic progression
:class: tip
You can play around with the behaviour of different arithmetic progessions by changing the values of $a$ and $d$:
````

```{code-cell}

  image:
    align: center

n = 10 # number of terms
a = 30 # first value
d = -4 # commmon difference
seq = a # first value of sequence
count = 0 # counter
while count < n: # while loop
       print(seq) # print series value    
       seq = seq + d # update sequence                 
       count += 1 # update counter
```




#### Solving the series of arithmetic progessions

Series of arithmetic progessions can be solved (i.e. reduced to a number).
The series (or the sum) $S_n$ of an arithmetic progression with recurrence relation $u_i=a+(i-1)d$ is:
```{math}
:label: seriessol
 S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i = \sum_{i=1}^n a + (i -1 ) d = \frac{n}{2} \big( 2 a + (n - 1) d \big) = \frac{n}{2} (a + L)
```
where $L = a + (n-1) d$ is the last term in the series.

As $n$ approaches $\infty$, the arithmetic progession approaches $\infty$ if $d>0$ and approaches $-\infty$ if
$d<0$.
In these cases we say that the series diverges (more on this later!).
Infinite arithmetic progressions always diverge, the proof of which can be found via
[this link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3334553/proof-that-arithmetic-series-diverges)
(although further reading is required!).

````{admonition} Python code for the series of the arithmetic progression
:class: note
You can use this code to convince yourself that the series of arithmetic progressions grow without bound for large $n$.  In this ecxample we pick $a = 30$, $d=-4$.

while count < nterms: # while loop

       seq = seq + d # update sequence
       ser = ser + seq # update series                   
       count += 1 # update counter
```


````{admonition} Proof of the solution of the series of arithmetic progressions
:class: note
```{math}
S_n = a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + \dots + \Big( a + (n-3) d \Big) + \Big( a + (n-2) d \Big) + \Big( a + (n-1) d \Big) \\
\\
S_n = \Big( a + (n-1) d \Big) + \Big( a + (n-2) d \Big) + \Big( a + (n-3) d \Big) + \dots + (a+2d) + (a+d) + a \ .
```
Adding these two expressions gives:
```{math}
2 S_n =  \Big( 2 a + (n-1) d \Big) + \Big( 2 a + (n-1) d \Big) + \dots + \Big( 2 a + (n-1) d \Big) \ .
```
Since there are $n$ terms, this equations simplifies to the final result:
```{math}
S_n =  \frac{n}{2} \Big( 2 a + (n-1) d \Big)  \ .
```

1\. This is an arithmetic progression (AP) with first term $a=54$, common difference $d=-2$, and last term $L=18$.

Since $L = a + (n-1)d$, we have $n = \frac{18-54}{-2} = 19$ terms.

2\. For an AP with first term $a=3$, and common difference $d=6$, the sum of the first $30$ terms is given by 
```{math}
S_{30} = \frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d = \frac{30}{2} (6 + 29 \times 6) = 2700
```

3\. For this AP the first term is $a=2$, the common difference is $d=2$.

The last term is given by $a+(n-1)d=10$, so we find that $n=5$.

The sum is given by $S_5 = \frac{5}{2} (2+10) = 30$.

4\. The first expression is an AP with first term $a=4$, last term $L=49$ and $n=10$ terms. 

The sum is $\frac{n}{2}(a+L)=265$.

The second expression is an AP with first term $n=100$, last term $L=1000$ and $n=901$ (take care!).

The sum is $\frac{n}{2} (a+L) = 495550$.

You could also calculate this using $\frac{1000}{2}(1+1000)−\frac{99}{2}(1+99)$.

5\. Let the first term of this AP be denoted by $a$, and the common difference be denoted by $d$.

We have that $a+2d=26$ and $a+7d=46$. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives $a=18$ and $d=4$.

The sum of the first $50$ terms is given by:
```{math}
S_{50}=\frac{50}{2}(2a+49d)=5800
```

6\. The series is given by $S=6+12+18+...+96 = \sum_{n=1}^{16} 6 n$.

This is the sum of an AP with first term $a=6$, last term $L=96$ and $n=16$ terms.

The result is $S= \frac{16}{2}(6+96)=816$.

### Geometric Progression

````{admonition} Definition
:class: note
A geometric progression (otherwise known as an geometric sequence) is a sequence of $n$ terms which have "common ratio"
$r$, written as follows:

```{math}
:label: gpdef
a, a r, a r^2, a r^3, \dots , a r^{n-1}
```
where $a$ is an arbitrary number.
````
Using the notation for sequences in the previous section, the $i$-th term of the geometric progression is
$u_i=a r^{i-1}$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$.
In other words, the next term in the geometric progression can be found by multiplying the previous term by the common
ratio $r$, given by the recurrence relation $u_i = r u_{i-1}$ where $u_1=a$.
An example is the sequence $24,−12,6,−3,1.5$ in which the first term is $a=2$, the common ratio is $r=−\frac{1}{2}$ and
the number of terms is $n=5$.


````{admonition} Python code for a geometric progression

Like arithmetic progessions, the series of geometric progressions can be solved (i.e. reduced to a number).
The series (or the sum) $S_n$ of a geometric progression $u_i=a r^{i-1}$ is:
```{math}

2\. The given expression represents the sum of a geometric progression (GP) with first term $a=729$ and common ratio $r=\frac{1}{3}$.

The sum over all integers n is given by $S_{\infty}=\frac{729}{1−1/3}=\frac{2187}{2}$.

3\. Let the first term of this GP be denoted by $a$ ($=8$), and the common ratio be denoted by $r$.

We have the sum of the first 3 terms is $8(1+r+r^2)=38$.

4\. The sum of the first $n$ terms in this GP is given by $S_n= 27 \frac{1−(4/3)^n}{1−4/3}$.

We require that $S_n>550$. The problem could be tackled by trial and error, but we will solve it analytically.

The problem rearranges to give $(\frac{4}{3})^n>\frac{631}{81}$ (take care with the direction of the inequality!).

By taking the natural logarithm we obtain 
```{math}
n > \frac{\ln \big( \frac{631}{81} \big)}{ \ln \big( \frac{4}{3} \big)}=7.136 \text{(4sf)}

&& = 123\Big(\frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{1000^2}  + \dots\Big)
```
which we can read as a geometris series, with $a = 123/1000$ and $r = 1/1000$, which means that:
```{math}
S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{\frac{123}{1000}}{1 - \frac{1}{1000}} = \frac{\frac{123}{1000}}{\frac{999}{1000}} = \frac{41}{333}
```
````

## Method of Differences

The method of differences provides a way to find a finite series (sum of a sequence) by using the difference of similar sums
to compute the desired result.  This is a handy trick to find the value of partial (finite) sums.

### Partial Fractions

Consider the problem of adding different fractions, for example: 
```{math} 
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{?}{??}
``` 
the easiest way to write this as one single fraction is to rewrite each fraction in terms of a common denominator and then just add the numerators.  
To find the common denominator, we need to find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, here LCM$(2,3) = 6$ and hence:
```{math} 
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6},   \quad\frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2 + 3}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
```
If we have two algebraic fractions, we can follow a similar process.  

An example: 
```{math} 
\frac{2}{n+1} + \frac{3}{n+2} = \frac{2(n+2) + 3(n+1)}{(n+1)(n+2)} = \frac{5n + 7}{(n+1)(n+2)} 
```
The idea behind partial fractions is to reverse this process, breaking up a composite fraction into its smaller fractional parts.

An example: 
```{math} \frac{3}{(n-1)(n+2)}
``` 
first split this up into:
```{math} 
\frac{2}{(n-1)(n+2)} = \frac{A}{n-1} + \frac{B}{n+2} 
``` 
and then recombine to set up equations to find the unknown coefficients: 
```{math} 
\frac{3}{(n-1)(n+2)} = \frac{A(n+2) + B(n-1)}{(n-1)(n+2)} \Rightarrow 3 = A(n+2) + B(n-1)
``` 
There are two (equally valid) methods to use at this point to find $A,\, B$: 

1. We can substitute in $n=1, \,-2$ into the equation, in each case: 
```{math}
\begin{array}{rlcl}
    n = 1: & 3  = 3A &\Rightarrow & A = 1 \\ 
    n = -2: & 3 = -3B & \Rightarrow& B  = -1
\end{array}
``` 
2. We can compare coefficients of $n^0$ and $n^1$ (which by the fundamental theorem of algebra are independent), producing a set of simultaneous equations: 
```{math} 
\begin{array}{rlcl}
    n^1: & A + B = 0 &\Rightarrow& B = -A\\ 
    n^0: & 2A - B = 3 &\Rightarrow& 2A + A = 3\\
         &  &\Rightarrow& A = 1,\, B = -1 
\end{array}
```

If we have repeated roots in the denominator,  the decomposition now has terms for each of the roots and an additional one for the repeated root.  

An example: 
```{math} 
g(n) = \frac{9}{(n+2)(n+5)^2} = \frac{A}{n+2} + \frac{B}{n+5} + \frac{C}{(n+5)^2} 
``` 
To find the partial fractions, recall we first combine: 
```{math} 
g(n) = \frac{A(n+5)^2 + B(n+2)(n+5) + C(n+2)}{(n+2)(n+5)^2}
``` 
and then substitute in values:
```{math} 
&&\begin{array}{rlcl}
n=-5: & (-3)C = 9 & \Rightarrow & C = - 3 \\ 
n = -2: & (3)^2A = 9 & \Rightarrow & A = 1 \\ 
n=0: & 25A + 10B + 2C = 9 & \Rightarrow & B=-1 
\end{array}\\
&&\Rightarrow g(n) = \frac{1}{n+2} - \frac{1}{n+5} - \frac{3}{(n+5)^2} 
```
````{admonition} An Application with Prime Factors
:class: seealso, dropdown

For a fraction like $ \frac{1}{18}$, can we decompose this into fractions of the prime factors $ 18 = 2\cdot 3^2$ ? The full partial fraction decomposition would have the form: 
```{math} 
\frac{1}{18} = \frac{A}{2} + \frac{B}{3} + \frac{C}{3^2}
``` 
First we have to present the system in a way that is meaningful to use partial fractions: 
```{math} 
f(n) = \frac{1}{(n+2)(n+3)^2} = \frac{A}{n+2} + \frac{B}{n+3} + \frac{C}{(n+3)^2}
``` 
so that we reduce to the original problem at $f(0)$.  Now we just follow the process 
```{math} 
\frac{1}{(n+2)(n+3)^2} = \frac{A(n+3)^2 + B(n+2)(n+3) + C(n+2)}{(n+2)(n+3)^2}
```
Substituting in values we find: 
```{math} 
\begin{array}{rlcl}
     n=-3: & (-1)C = 1 &\Rightarrow& C = -1 \\
      n = -2: & (1)^2 A = 1&\Rightarrow& A = 1\\
      n = 0: & 9A + 6B + 2C = 1 &\Rightarrow& B = -1
\end{array}
``` 
giving the final decomposition:
```{math} 
f(n) = \frac{1}{n+2} - \frac{1}{n+3} - \frac{1}{(n+3)^2} \Rightarrow 
f(0) = \frac{1}{18} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3^2}
```

### Writing out the series method

Lets start with a simple example:
```{math}
S_1 = \sum_{n=1}^5 \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}\right)
```
we can expand out this series term by term and see some cancellation occurs:
```{math}
\begin{array}{rcccrccl}
       S_1 = \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2} &&&& S_1 = \frac{1}{1} \,- \not{\frac{1}{2}}&&\\
        + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} &&&&  + \not{\frac{1}{2}} \,- \not{\frac{1}{3}}&&  \\
        + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} &&\Rightarrow&&  + \not{\frac{1}{3}}\, - \not{\frac{1}{4}} && \Rightarrow S_1 = 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}  \\
        + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{5} &&&&  + \not{\frac{1}{4}} \,- \not{\frac{1}{5}}&&  \\
        + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{6} &&&&  + \not{\frac{1}{5}} \,- \frac{1}{6}&& \\
\end{array}
```
A question may appear not to have an obvious difference set out, such as:
```{math} 
S_2 = \sum_{n=1}^{5}\frac{2}{n(n+2)}
``` 
For a fraction of this form however, we can make use of partial fractions:
```{math}
\frac{2}{n(n+2)} = \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n+2} = \frac{A(n+2)+Bn}{n(n+2)} 
```
Equating numerators gives:
```{math}
(A+B)n + 2A = 2 \Rightarrow A = 1, B = -1
```
and so looking again at the series:
```{math}
S_2 = \sum_{n=1}^{5} \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+2} \right)
```
which is now in the form of method of differences.  
Expanding out the first few and last few terms allows us to spot the pattern:
```{math}
    \begin{array}{rcccrccl}
       S_2 = \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{3} &&&& S_2 = \frac{1}{1} \,- \not{\frac{1}{3}}&&\\
        + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} &&&&  + \frac{1}{2} \,- \not{\frac{1}{4}}&& \\
       + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5} &&\Rightarrow&&  + \not{\frac{1}{3}} \,- \not{\frac{1}{5}}&& \Rightarrow S_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{7} = \frac{25}{21} \\
        + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{6} &&&&  + \not{\frac{1}{4}} \,- \frac{1}{6}&& \\
        + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} &&&&  + \not{\frac{1}{5}} \,- \frac{1}{7}&& 
    \end{array}
```


If we have a series which is composed of an infinite number of terms, it is possible to apply the method of differences to see if it converges.  An example:
```{math}
S_3 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}\right)
```
which we can rewrite as:
```{math}
S_4 = \sum_{n=1}^N \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}\right)
```
and after solving by method of differences, take the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$:
```{math} 
S_4 = 1 - \frac{1}{N+1} \Rightarrow S_3 = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{N+1}\right) = 1
```


### Rewriting the summation index method

It is possible to demonstrate the cancellation of terms without writing out the terms in the series.

In general, rewriting the summation index provides:
```{math}
\sum_{r=1}^N f(r+c) = \sum_{r=1+c}^{N+c} f(r) \ ,
```
where $f(r)$ is an arbitrary function of summation index $r$ and $c$ is a postive integer number.

This can be also used for negative integer values:
```{math}
\sum_{r=1}^N f(r-c) = \sum_{r=1-c}^{N-c} f(r) \ .
```
You will find that this technique can drastically simplify summations we wish to solve.

For example:
```{math}
\sum_{r=1}^N \frac{2^{r+5}}{ \sqrt{r+5}} = \sum_{r=6}^{N+5} \frac{2^{r}}{ \sqrt{r}} \ .
```

1. Use the result $(r+1)^2 - (r-1)^2 = 4r$ to calculate $\sum_{r = 1}^{N} r$ using both the writing out series and rewring the summation methods.
2. By using partial fractions or otherwise, rewrite the summand and use method of differences to show that:

1\. 
```{math}
&&\sum_{r=1}^N r = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{r=1}^N \Big[ (r+1)^2 - (r-1)^2\Big] \\
&&= \frac{1}{4}\Big[2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + \dots + (N-1)^2 + N^2 + (N+1)^2 \\
&&- 0^2 - 1^2 - 2^2 - \dots - (N-2)^2 - (N-1)^2\Big]\\
&&= \frac{1}{4}(N^2 + (N+1)^2 - 1) = \frac{1}{4}(2N^2 + 2N)\\

OR 
```{math}
&&\sum_{r=1}^N r = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{r=1}^N \Big[ (r+1)^2 - (r-1)^2\Big] \\
&&= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{r=1}^N (r+1)^2 - \frac{1}{4}\sum_{r=1}^N(r-1)^2 \\
&&= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{r=2}^{N+1} r^2 - \frac{1}{4}\sum_{r=0}^{N-1}r^2 \\

2\. 
Let 
```{math}
\frac{2}{2(r+1)(r+2)}  = \frac{A}{r} + \frac{B}{r+1} + \frac{C}{r+2}= \frac{A(r+1)(r+2) + B r (r+2) + Cr (r+1)}{ r (r+1) (r+2)}
```
By equating coefficients of $r^0$, $r^1$ and $r^2$, we obtain $A=1$, $B=-2$, $C=1$ and so:
```{math}
\sum_{r=1}^n \frac{2}{2(r+1)(r+2)} =\sum_{r=1}^n \frac{1}{r} - 2 \sum_{r=1}^n \frac{1}{r+1} + \sum_{r=1}^n \frac{1}{r+2}
```
We can use either method to find the method of differences, using the rewriting the summation method:
```{math}
&&\sum_{r=1}^n \frac{1}{r} - 2 \sum_{r=1}^n \frac{1}{r+1} + \sum_{r=1}^n \frac{1}{r+2}\\
&&= \sum_{r=1}^n \frac{1}{r} - 2 \sum_{r=2}^{n+1} \frac{1}{r} + \sum_{r=3}^{n+2} \frac{1}{r}\\
&&= \sum_{r=1}^2 \frac{1}{r} + \sum_{r=3}^n \frac{1}{r} - 2\Big(\sum_{r=2}^2 \frac{1}{r} + \sum_{r=3}^n \frac{1}{r} + \sum_{r=n+1}^{n+1} \frac{1}{r}\Big) + \sum_{r=3}^n \frac{1}{r} + \sum_{r=n+1}^{n+2} \frac{1}{r}\\
&&= (1-2+1) \sum_{r=3}^n \frac{1}{r} + \Big( \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} \Big) -2 \Big( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{n+1} \Big) +\big( \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2} \big)\\
