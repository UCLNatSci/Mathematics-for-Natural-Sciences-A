# Line Integrals

Following on from the idea of breaking up a function into infintesimal sections $\mathrm{d} s$, we can think about a path through a vector field $\bf A(r)$, as depicted 
in {numref}`lineintegral`.  Starting from some vector $\bf r_A$ we can follow some path through the vector field (which we denote $C$), with the path following the 
field's direction at each point before finishing at point $\bf r_B$:

```{math}
I = \int_C {\bf G(r)} \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r}
```

name: lineintegral

Ilustration of a line integral, with $I = \int_C {\bf G(r)}\cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r}$
```

We see that that this is a scalar, found from the scalar product of $\bf G$ with the differential line element $\mathrm{d}{\bf r}$.  

IF we pick a closed path, we call this a <b>Loop Integral</b>:

```{math}
I = \oint_C {\bf G(r)} \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r}
```

## Calculating Line Integrals

Whilst the notation for a line integral looks compact, it does not really make it clear <em>how</em> we can evaluate over a path $C$.  In order to make progress, 
we need to parametrise the path, lets say with some variable $t$:

```{math}
t &\rightarrow&\, {\bf r}(t) \\
[a,\, b] &\rightarrow&\, \mathbb{R}^3
```

which means the path runs ${\bf r_A} = {\bf r}(a) \rightarrow {\bf r_B} = {\bf r}(b)$.  Looking at the line element:

```{math}
\mathrm{d}{\bf r}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{d}x (t) \\ \mathrm{d}y (t) \\\mathrm{d}z (t)\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} x'\mathrm{d}t \\ y'\mathrm{d}t \\ z'\mathrm{d}t\end{pmatrix} = {\bf r}'(t)\,\mathrm{d} t
```

and thus to express this as an integral in a way we can calculate it, with some parameter $t$:

```{math}
I = \int_C {\bf G}(r) \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r} = \int_a^b {\bf G}({\bf r}(t)) \cdot {\bf r}'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t

```

### Examples of Line Integrals
As an example lets consider the vector field:
```{math}
{\bf G(r)} = \begin{pmatrix} xy\\ -y^2 \end{pmatrix}
```
and look at the line integral over the points $(0,\, 0) \rightarrow (1,2)$ across different paths.  Lets pick the parameter $t$ to be the 
$x$ coordinate, so that the path if determined by $y = f(x), \, x \in [a,\, b]$ such that:

```{math}
{\bf r}(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ f(x) \end{pmatrix}
```

Lets consider different paths:

- Straight line path 

The function following by this path will be $y = 2x,\, x \in [0, 1]$, so:

```{math}
{\bf r}(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x \end{pmatrix}
```

Thus ${\bf G}({\bf r}(x))$ will be:

```{math}
{\bf G}({\bf r}(x)) = \begin{pmatrix} 2x^2 \\ -4x^2 \end{pmatrix}
```

and ${\bf r'}(x)$ is given by:

```{math}
{\bf r}'(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
```

so the line integral is found by:

```{math}
I &=  \int_C {\bf G}(r) \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r} = \int_0^1 {\bf G}({\bf r}(t)) \cdot {\bf r}'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t = 
\int_0^1 \begin{pmatrix} 2x^2 \\ -4x^2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \mathrm{d}x \\
&=  \int_0^1 \left( 2x^2 - 8x^2 \right)\,\textrm{d}x = -\int_0^1 6x^2 \,\textrm{d}x = \Big[ -\frac{6}{3}x^3\Big ]_0^1 = -2
```

- Curved path following $y = x^2$


```{math}
{\bf r}(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ x^2 \end{pmatrix}
```

Thus ${\bf G}({\bf r}(x))$ will be:

```{math}
{\bf G}({\bf r}(x)) = \begin{pmatrix} x^3 \\ -x^4 \end{pmatrix}
```

and ${\bf r'}(x)$ is given by:

```{math}
{\bf r}'(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2x \end{pmatrix}
```

so the line integral is found by:

```{math}
I &=  \int_C {\bf G}(r) \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r} = \int_0^1 {\bf G}({\bf r}(t)) \cdot {\bf r}'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t = 
\int_0^1 \begin{pmatrix} x^3 \\ -x^4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2x \end{pmatrix} \mathrm{d}x \\
&=  \int_0^1 \left( x^3 - 2x^5 \right)\,\textrm{d}x = \Big[\frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{1}{3}x^6 \Big ]_0^1 = -\frac{1}{12}
```

- Curved path following $y = x^{1/2}$


```{math}
{\bf r}(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ x^{1/2} \end{pmatrix}
```

Thus ${\bf G}({\bf r}(x))$ will be:

```{math}
{\bf G}({\bf r}(x)) = \begin{pmatrix} x^{3/2} \\ -x \end{pmatrix}
```

and ${\bf r'}(x)$ is given by:

```{math}
{\bf r}'(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2} \end{pmatrix}
```

so the line integral is found by:

```{math}
I &=  \int_C {\bf G}(r) \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r} = \int_0^1 {\bf G}({\bf r}(t)) \cdot {\bf r}'(t)\,\mathrm{d}t = 
\int_0^1 \begin{pmatrix} x^{3/2} \\ -x \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2} \end{pmatrix} \mathrm{d}x \\
&=  \int_0^1 \left( x^{3/2} - \frac{1}{2}x^{1/2} \right)\,\textrm{d}x = \Big[\frac{2}{5}x^{5/2} - \frac{1}{3}x^{3/2} \Big ]_0^1 = \frac{1}{15}
```

## Conservative Vector Fields

There is an important class of vector fields, known as <b>conservative vector fields</b>, for which line integrals do not depend on 
which path is taken from rA to rB, and for which all loop integrals are zero.  We see that our example 
```{math}
{\bf G(r)} = xy\hat{\bf x} - y^2 \hat{\bf y}
```
is not conservative since the line integrals along different paths from $(0,\, 0)$ to $(1,\,2)$ gave different values.  

Whist it is not possible show that for all paths ${\bf r}_A \rightarrow {\bf r}_B$. the line integral gives the same value, simply because there exist
infinitely many possible paths. Instead we can use an equivalent definition of conservative fields:

```{math}
\text{Vector Field}\,{\bf G(r)}\,\text{is conservative} \Longleftrightarrow \exists\, \text{Scalar Field}\,\phi({\bf r}),\, 
\text{s.t.}\,{\bf G} = \nabla \phi
```

To show that a vector field which satisfies this condition is conservative, lets think about a line integral taken along a path 
${\bf r}_A \rightarrow {\bf r}_B$, which we have parameterised by the $t \in [a,\, b]$, where ${\bf}(t=a) = {\bf r}_A$ and ${\bf}(t=b) = {\bf r}_B$
```{math}
I &=  \int_C {\bf G(r)}\cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r} = \int_{t=a}^{t=b} {\bf G(r)}\cdot {\bf r}'(t) \mathrm{d}t\\
&=  \int_{t=a}^{t=b} (\nabla \phi({\bf r}(t)))\cdot {\bf r}'(t) \mathrm{d}t
```
However using the fact that the total differential $\mathrm{d}\phi = \nabla \phi \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r}$, 
then $\mathrm{d}\phi/\mathrm{d}t = \nabla \phi \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r}'$ and thus:
```{math}
I &=  \int_{t=a}^{t=b} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\phi({\bf r}(t)) \mathrm{d}t  \\
&=  \Bigg[ \phi({\bf r}(t)) \Bigg]_{t=a}^{t=b} = \phi({\bf r_B}) - \phi({\bf r_A})
```
which means that the details of the line integral only depend on the start and finish of the contour, not the path taken.  Likewise if we have a 
conservative vector field and a closed loop integral, then ${\bf r_A} = \bf{r_B}$ and so the integral becomes zero.

For a three dimensional vector field defined on a domain that is <em>simply connected</em> (that is contains no holes) there exists another 
equivalent definition of conservativeness:
```{math}
\text{Vector Field}\,{\bf G(r)}\,\text{is conservative} \Longleftrightarrow \nabla \times {\bf G} = 0
```

An example, is the vector ${\bf G(r)} = 2xy \hat{\bf x} + (x^2 - 2y)\hat{\bf y} + \hat{\bf z}$ is conservative?

Since G is defined on the entire three-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^3$, we can make use the curl criterion, hence
```{math}
\nabla \times {\bf G} &= 
\begin{pmatrix} \partial_y G_z - \partial_z G_y \\ \partial_z G_x - \partial_x G_y \\ \partial_y G_x - \partial_x G_y\end{pmatrix}\\
&=  \begin{pmatrix} 0 - 0 \\ 0 - 0 \\ 2x - 2x\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
```
Hence since the curl of $\bf G$ is zero, $\bf G$ is a conservative vector field, so it must be possible to find a potential $\phi({\bf r})$ such 
that ${\bf G} = \nabla \phi$.  This means that:

- $\partial_x \phi = 2xy$
- $\partial_x \phi = x^2-2y$
- $\partial_x \phi = 1$

Integrating each of these in turn we find that:

- $\phi = x^2y + f(y,\,z)$
- $\phi = x^2y - y^2 + g(x,\,z)$
- $\phi = z + h(z,\,y)$

Since these all need to be consistent, we find that 
```{math}
\phi(x,\,y,\,z) = x^2y - y^2 + z + C
```
up to an additive constant $C \in \mathbb{C}$.  We notice that for the line integral this constant drops out of the calculation anyway.
