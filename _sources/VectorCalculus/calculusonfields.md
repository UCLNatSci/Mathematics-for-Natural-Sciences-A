# Vector Fields

A field in a mathematical sense is some function which can be defined within some domain $D$, we will examine fields in two and three spatial dimensions, 
(but this can be extended to more later as required), therefore $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ or $D \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ respectively.  If $D$ is not specified, then 
we assume the whole of the space is being used as the domain.

In a physical sense, a field is some physical quantity which has a value at every point within a space, examples of which include temperature, distances, velocities, 
acceleations, forces, electric and magnetic fields.  

One impoirtant distinction to make between fields is whether they are <b>Scalar</b>, <b>Vector</b> or some other (e.g. <b>Tensor</b> although this is beyond 
the scope of this course).

### Scalar Fields
A scalar field is a physical quantity which has some value (or magnitude) but contains no information about direction, at every point ${\bf r} = (x, \,y, \,z)$ 
within a domain. Physical examples include pressure and temperature.  Mathematically we can write this as a function $\phi$ such that:

```{math}
\phi \,:\, D \,\subset\, \mathbb{R}^3 \,&\longrightarrow&\, \mathbb{R} \\
{\bf r} &\longrightarrow&\, \phi({\bf r})
```

### Vector Fields
A vector field A scalar field is a physical quantity which has both magnitude and direction, at every point ${\bf r} = (x, \,y, \,z)$ within a domain.  Physical 
examples include velocity, force, and electric and magnetic fields.  Mathematically we can write this as a function $\bf A(r)$ such that:

```{math}
\phi \,:\, D \,\subset\, \mathbb{R}^3 \,&\longrightarrow&\, \mathbb{R}^3 \\
{\bf r} &\longrightarrow&\, {\bf A(r)} = \begin{pmatrix}
 A_x ({\bf r})\\
 A_y ({\bf r})\\
 A_z ({\bf r}) 
\end{pmatrix}
```

We can picture these fields in {numref}`scalarvectorfield`, outlining the difference between scalar and vecor fields.

## Calculus on Fields

### Gradient Operator
Now that we have defined fields, which can vary according to different parameters at every point within a domain, we can begin to apply 
our toolkit of mathematical tools, here calculus.  

We can find the partial derivatives of fields in a similar way to functions, for example for $\phi = \exp(-(x^2+y^2)$, ${\bf A(r)} = \frac{1}{10}\begin{pmatrix}
 x\\
 y^2
\end{pmatrix}$:
```{math}
\partial_x \phi &=  -2x\,\exp(-(x^2+y^2) \\
\partial_y \phi &=  -2y\,\exp(-(x^2+y^2) \\
\partial_x {\bf A(r)} &=  \frac{1}{10}\begin{pmatrix}
 1\\
 0
\end{pmatrix} \\
\partial_y {\bf A(r)} &=  \frac{1}{10}\begin{pmatrix}
 0\\
 2y
\end{pmatrix} 
```

These partial derivatives measure the change of $\phi$ along the directions of $x$ or $y$, but can we calculate the derivative of $\phi$ along some 
general direction, characterised by a unit vector $\hat{\bf u}$:
```{math}
\hat{\bf u} = \begin{pmatrix}
 u_x\\
 u_y\\
 u_z
\end{pmatrix} 
```
We need a directional derivative, which can tell us about the changes in $\phi$ along each component of $\hat{\bf u}.  This leads us to the gradient
operator:
```{math}
\nabla = \begin{pmatrix}
 \partial/\partial x \\
 \partial/\partial y \\
 \partial/\partial z 
\end{pmatrix} 
```
which as an operator needs to act on a scalar field:
```{math}
\nabla \phi = \begin{pmatrix}
 \partial\phi/\partial x \\
 \partial\phi/\partial y \\
 \partial\phi/\partial z 
\end{pmatrix} 
```
We see that this is now a vector field, which we can resolve in the $\hat{\bf u}$ direction:

```{math}
\hat{\bf u} \cdot \nabla \phi
```

which is our <b>directional derivative</b> of $\phi$ in the $\hat{\bf u}$ direction, which we often write as $\nabla_{\hat{\bf u}} \phi$.  

Looking at this expression further:

```{math}
|\nabla_{\hat{\bf u}} \phi| = \hat{\bf u} \cdot \nabla \phi = |\hat{\bf u}||\nabla \phi|\cos (\theta) = |\nabla \phi|\cos (\theta)
```

therefore $|\nabla_{\hat{\bf u}} \phi|$ is maximised when $\theta = 0$ - The gradient $\nabla \phi$ of a scalar field $\phi$ always points toward the 
direction of maximum increase of $\phi$ (i.e. a maxima).  

Likewise the directional derivative is zero when $\theta = \pi/2$, i.e. tangential surfaces, which would be given by $\phi({\bf r}) = C$ which is 
one dimension lower than the dimension of the problem (therefore in 3D, these would be surface areas, in 2D there would be contour lines).

As example, lets consider $\phi = \exp(-(x^2+y^2)$ defined over the domain $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$:
```{math}
\nabla \phi = \begin{pmatrix}
 -2x\,\exp(-(x^2+y^2) \\
 -2y\,\exp(-(x^2+y^2)
\end{pmatrix} = -2\,\exp(-(x^2+y^2) \begin{pmatrix}
 x \\
 y
\end{pmatrix}
```
We see that for all $x,\, y$ within the domain, the vector will be directed inwards, as we see in {numref}`scalarfieldgradient`.

Gradients $\nabla \phi$ for a scalar field $\phi({\bf r}) = \exp(-(x^2+y^2))$ at a few different points along the contour plot (denoted 
$\bf r=r_0$).  The gradients are perpendicular to the contour lines and point toward the direction of the largest increase of $\phi$, 
which from {numref}`scalarvectorfield` we know is a maxima.
```

The gradient of $\phi(x,\,y,\,z)$ will therefore be perpendicular to the surface $\phi=c$, and we can use this to find the tangent plane 
to the surface at a given point.  The gradient of $z = z(x,\,y)$ will be perpendicular to the contours of $z$, projected in the $(x,\,y)$ plane, 
as illustrated in {numref}`quiver`.

```{figure} ../figures/quiver.png

A contour plot of the surface $z = x^3−y^3−2xy+2$, together with the gradient field given by $\nabla z = (3x^2−2y,\,−3y^2−2x,\,0)$.
```

We can always take some surface $z = z(x,\,y)$ and convert it into a scalar field $\phi$ with some surface normal ${\bf n} = \nabla \phi$, for instance
$z = x^3−y^3−2xy+2$ means we can write $\phi = x^3−y^3−2xy+2 - z$ and therefore:
```{math}
{\bf n} = \nabla \phi = \begin{pmatrix} 3x^2 - 2y \\ -3y^2 - 2x \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
```

If we want to find the equation of the resulting tangent surface at a given point, say $A:(1,\,1,\,0)$, then we know that the scalar products of all vectors 
$\begin{pmatrix} x\\y\\z \end{pmatrix}$ on the tangent surface with the surface normal must agree, hence:
```{math}
{\bf n}_A &=  \begin{pmatrix} 3-2\\-3-2\\0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1\\-5\\0 \end{pmatrix} \\
{\bf n}_A\cdot \begin{pmatrix} x\\y\\z \end{pmatrix} &=  {\bf n}_A\cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1\\1\\0 \end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow x - 5y - z  =-4
```

Another example would be to find the gradient of the function $f(x,\,y,\,z) = xyz$ at the point $(−2,\,3,\,4)$ and also find the directional 
derivative of this function in the direction ${\bf v} = (3, \,-4, \,12)$.   We can find $\nabla f$:

```{math}
\nabla f = (yz,\,xz,\, xy) \Rightarrow \nabla f\Bigg|_{(−2,\,3,\,4)} = (12,\, -8,\, -6)
```
and therefore the directional derivative is given by:
```{math}
\frac{1}{|{\bf v}|}{\bf v} \cdot \nabla f\Bigg|_{(−2,\,3,\,4)} \Rightarrow 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 12^2}} (3, \,-4, \,12)\cdot (12,\, -8,\, -6) = -\frac{4}{13}
```
  
## Total Differential

Recall from our discussions about partial derivatives, we can also define a <em>scalar total differential</em>:
```{math}
\mathrm{d}\phi = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \mathrm{d} x + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \mathrm{d} y + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} \mathrm{d} z
```
which measures the infinitesimal change of  $\phi$ as we change $x, \,y,\,z$ by infinitesimal amounts $\mathrm{d}x, \,\mathrm{d}y,\, \mathrm{d}z$.  
Likewise we can define the vectorial line element:
```{math}
\mathrm{d}{\bf r} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{d}x \\\mathrm{d}y\\ \mathrm{d}z\end{pmatrix}
```
or to write in a slightly more compact notation:
```{math}
\mathrm{d}\phi = \nabla \phi \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf r}
```
To find the <em>vector total differential</em>:
```{math}
\mathrm{d}{\bf A} = \frac{\partial {\bf A} }{\partial x} \mathrm{d} x + \frac{\partial {\bf A} }{\partial y} \mathrm{d} y + \frac{\partial {\bf A} }{\partial z} \mathrm{d} z

```
